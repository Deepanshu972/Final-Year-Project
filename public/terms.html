                                PSYCLE has endeavoured to ensure that all the information provided by it is correct, but
                                CMB neither warrants nor makes any representations regarding the quality, accuracy or
                                completeness of any data or information. CMB makes no warranty, express or implied,
                                concerning the website and/or its contents and disclaims all warranties of fitness for a
                                particular purpose and warranties of merchantability in respect of products, including
                                any liability, responsibility or any other claim, whatsoever, in respect of any loss,
                                whether direct or consequential, to any user or any other person, arising out of or from
                                the use of any such information.
                                PSYCLE shall further not have responsibility or liability in relation to the validity of
                                the legal rights related to third party content. All third party intellectual property
                                rights as displayed on the website are owned by respective parties and CMB does not
                                claim any rights over the same. The mere displaying of information, the intellectual
                                property related thereto by third parties, does not in any way imply, suggest, or
                                constitute CMB’s sponsorship or approval of related third-parties, or any affiliation

                                Although PSYCLE makes reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the description and
                                content in each page of the website is correct, it does not, however, take
                                responsibility for changes that occurred due to human or data entry errors or for any
                                loss or damages suffered by any user due to any information contained herein.

                                PSYCLE does not endorse any advertiser on its website in any manner. The users are
                                requested to verify the accuracy of all information on their own before undertaking any
                                reliance on such information.

                                In no event shall PSYCLE be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental,
                                special, consequential damages or any other damages resulting from: (a) the use or the
