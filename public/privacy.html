                        When you use our portal, we collect and store personal information provided by you. Our
                        primary goal in doing this is to provide a safe, efficient and customized experience. This

                        customize our portal to make your experience safer and easier. Importantly, we only collect
                        personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. In
                        general, you can browse the portal without telling us who you are or revealing any personal
                        information about yourself. To be able to use every feature of our portal, you will need to
                        register and provide us your contact information and other personal information as indicated
                        on the form. We may automatically track certain information about you based on your behavior

                        interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information
                        is compiled and analyzed on regular basis. We use data collection devices such as "cookies"
                        on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional
                        effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. If you choose to buy bicycles, accessories or
                        apparel using the portal, we collect information about your buying and selling behavior. If
                        you choose to post messages on the portal or leave feedback for other users, we will collect
                        that information. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide
                        customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. If you send us personal
                        correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us
                        correspondence about your activities or postings on the portal, we may collect such
                        information.
